# Corona_Chest_Diagnosis

Given the chest X-ray dateset, our goal is to build a range of neural networks to diagnose chest X-rays. Our database consists of patients suffering from COVID-19, Pneumonia, and normal Patients

## Data Exploration
* [DataSet Link](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
* Spliting data into training, validation, and testing.

## Basic Models
* Building a fully connected neural network. [many layers & few ones]
* Building a convolutional neural network with a classification layer at the end. [many layers & few ones]

## Improved Models
* famous backbones used ResNet 18  & DenseNet
